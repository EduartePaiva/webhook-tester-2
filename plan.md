Plan for webhook tester version 2

-   It'll be a monorepo of the react frontend + the api backend
-   It'll use docker compose to run a dev environment and a prod environment
-   It'll use nginx as the reverse proxy for both
-   The dev environment will use a local postgres instance, in docker
-   I'll document the api using OpenAPI
-   The monorepo will use pnpm
